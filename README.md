IMPLEMENT A MOTOR TESTER

This project is a bootcamp challenge from the firmware Waterloo Aerial Robotics Team.

My task was to input a potentiometer value from 0 to 3.3V and convert it to a PWM signal to control a motor using STM32 Cube IDE. 
The main compon of this project was to code the full duplex ADC communication over the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). Then the next part was to convert the ADC signal to pulse width modulation signal that woul dbe used to control the motor.

Th emain takeaway from this bootcamnp task was SPI communication.
